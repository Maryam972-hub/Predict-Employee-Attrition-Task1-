# Predict-Employee-Attrition-Task1-
This project, presents a data-driven approach to understanding and predicting employee turnover within an organization. The notebook systematically explores a real-world HR dataset to uncover key factors contributing to attrition. It begins with comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and insights, followed by rigorous data preprocessing including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling to ensure high-quality input for machine learning models.

The project then implements predictive modeling using classification algorithms to accurately forecast whether an employee is likely to leave. Model performance is evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix to ensure robustness and reliability. In addition to prediction, the analysis concludes with actionable business insights aimed at reducing attritionâ€”such as limiting excessive overtime and improving overall job satisfaction. This project demonstrates the practical application of machine learning in solving real-world HR challenges and supports data-driven decision-making to enhance employee retention and organizational effectiveness.
